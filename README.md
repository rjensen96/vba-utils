# vba-utils

## Hang on a minute because I need to write more here.

These files are a set of functions that I wrote to make VBA less terrible. I hope these functions will make VBA less terrible for you, too.

In time, I'll write up some documentation for these and post that here. For now, just know that the most useful of these files are `zListObjects.bas` and `zCollections.bas`. I'm stashing the other files here because they exist but I will comb through these and I may destroy some of the other ones. 

The functions in `zListObjects` and `zCollections` should be fairly well-tested and should perform decently well. No guarantees, though. Log an issue or PR if you wanna help make these better.
